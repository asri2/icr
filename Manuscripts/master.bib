@article{Baillie1990,
abstract = {ABSTRACT Most asset pricing models postulate a positive relationship between a stock portfolio's expected returns and risk, which is often modeled by the variance of the asset price. This paper uses GARCH in mean models to examine the relationship between mean returns on a stock portfolio and its conditional variance or standard deviation. After estimating a variety of models from daily and monthly portfolio return data, we conclude that any relationship between mean returns and own variance or standard deviation is weak. The results suggest that investors consider some other risk measure to be more important than the variance of portfolio returns.},

Using a conditional variance framework, we find that the day of the week effect is present in both return and volatility equations.

For most of the markets, the days with the highest volatility also coincide with that market's lowest trading volume. Thus, this paper supports the argument made by Foster and Viswanathan [Rev.

abstract = {This paper systematically examines daily returns of the Thai Stock Market Index to determine whether there is evidence of calendar effects due to the day of the week, the month of the year, days before or after holidays and within-month effects. Particular attention is given to the evidence of these anomalies prior to, during and after the Asian crisis. Most of the previous empirical evidence examines each of these effects in isolation. The approach adopted within this paper is to start with a general model, which incorporates a range of different calendar anomalies before estimating the conditional volatility models. Daily data from 3rd January 1995 to 29th December 2000 are used for estimation providing 1473 observations. The final models are tested by comparing their forecast performance for 2001 (244 observations) with various models, which do not include calendar effects. The conclusion is that the inclusion of calendar effects improves the forecast accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Alexakis1995,
abstract = {Evidence is presented concentrating on the day of the week effect on the Greek stock market, which is currently in a transitory stage. The analysis carried out takes into account that the variance is dependent over time, while an EGARCH-M model investigates the volatility which is considered non-constant over time. During the period examined, January 1985 to February 1994 this market is divided into two subperiods, one in which it operated under backward statutory conditions and the recent one, that is since 1988, during which significant changes have been introduced affecting all market players. A positive return is found for Mondays when the total period is examined, as well as in the first subperiod. Tuesdays, on the other hand, show negative returns. The recent changes, however, since 1988 have established a new pattern of returns which comes closer to that of most other national stock markets. Factors relating to the degree of order established in this market in combination with human behaviour patterns are used to explain these findings. On the side of moments, both preliminary evidence and further investigation of the dependencies depict a changing pattern as well. {\textcopyright} 1995, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.

He believes this shows that empirics currently hold sway over theories in regards to market examination.},

@article{French1986,
abstract = {Asset prices are much more volatile during exchange trading hours than during non-trading hours. This paper considers three explanations for this phenomenon: (1) volatility is caused by public information which is more likely to arrive during normal business hours; (2) volatility is caused by private information which affects prices when informed investors trade; and (3) volatility is caused by pricing errors that occur during trading. Although a significant fraction of the daily variance is caused by mispricing, the behavior of returns around exchange holidays suggests that private information is the principle factor behind high trading-time variances.},

Sumiyana (2007a) investigates trading and nontrading periods return only, or it doesn't split intra-day return into short interval period. Although Sumiyana (2007a) found strongly the phenomenon of the Monday effect, but it could not capture the inside occurrence in the intra-trading periods. This study examines the day of the week and Monday effect phenomena in the Indonesian Stock Exchange using intraday data in every 30 minutes interval. Samples of the data are the firms listed in LQ45. Sequentially, samples are filtered to stocks that actively traded in the Indonesian Stock Exchange based on trading frequency in observation period from January to December 2006. This study uses regression analysis with multiple dummies constructed by separating trading periods in every day into 12 return periods. This research finds that day of the week phenomena occur consistently in Indonesian Stock Exchange, but the occurrence are not evenly in the same day. In addition, this study concludes that Monday effect exists partially and incidentally only.},
