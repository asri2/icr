abstract = {Evidence is presented concentrating on the day of the week effect on the Greek stock market, which is currently in a transitory stage. The analysis carried out takes into account that the variance is dependent over time, while an EGARCH-M model investigates the volatility which is considered non-constant over time. During the period examined, January 1985 to February 1994 this market is divided into two subperiods, one in which it operated under backward statutory conditions and the recent one, that is since 1988, during which significant changes have been introduced affecting all market players. A positive return is found for Mondays when the total period is examined, as well as in the first subperiod. Tuesdays, on the other hand, show negative returns. The recent changes, however, since 1988 have established a new pattern of returns which comes closer to that of most other national stock markets. Factors relating to the degree of order established in this market in combination with human behaviour patterns are used to explain these findings. On the side of moments, both preliminary evidence and further investigation of the dependencies depict a changing pattern as well. {\textcopyright} 1995, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.

Particular attention is given to the evidence of these anomalies prior to, during and after the Asian crisis. Most of the previous empirical evidence examines each of these effects in isolation. The approach adopted within this paper is to start with a general model, which incorporates a range of different calendar anomalies before estimating the conditional volatility models. Daily data from 3rd January 1995 to 29th December 2000 are used for estimation providing 1473 observations. The final models are tested by comparing their forecast performance for 2001 (244 observations) with various models, which do not include calendar effects. The conclusion is that the inclusion of calendar effects improves the forecast accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Return and risk are the starting points for any discussion of portfolio management. Market convention is to report total returns in annual percentage terms. Total returns can be further decomposed in income and capital gains components, a distinction which is important for forecasting long-term returns, as discussed on page 8. For bonds and stocks, the income should be apparent (coupon on bonds, dividends on stocks); these are supplemented by an capital gain or loss from the change in price over time. For currencies, income is derived from the libor rate differential between two countries (carry), and capital gain or loss from the change in the spot exchange rate. For commodity futures, income is derived from any price difference in successive futures contracts which are rolled (the roll yield), and capital gains from the rise or fall of prices over the investment horizon.},

This paper uses GARCH in mean models to examine the relationship between mean returns on a stock portfolio and its conditional variance or standard deviation. After estimating a variety of models from daily and monthly portfolio return data, we conclude that any relationship between mean returns and own variance or standard deviation is weak. The results suggest that investors consider some other risk measure to be more important than the variance of portfolio returns.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the day of the week effect in the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE) General Index over a ten year period divided into two subperiods: 1995-2000 and 2001-2004. Five major indices are also considered: Banking, Insurance, and Miscellaneous for the first subperiod, and FTSE-20 and FTSE-40 for the second subperiod. Using a conditional variance framework, which extends previous work on the Greek stock market, we test for possible existence of day of the week variation in both return and volatility equations. When using the GARCH (1,1) specification only for the return equation and the Modified-GARCH (1,1) specification for both the return and volatility equations, findings indicate that the day of the week effect is present for the examined indices of the emerging ASE over the period 1995-2000. However, this stock market anomaly seems to loose its strength and significance in the ASE over the period 2001-2004, which might be due to the Greek entry to the Euro-Zone and the market upgrade to the developed. },

A key feature is a measurement equation that relates the realized measure to the conditional variance of returns. The measurement equation facilitates a simple modeling of the dependence between returns and future volatility. Realized GARCH models with a linear or log-linear specification have many attractive features. They are parsimonious, simple to estimate, and imply an ARMA structure for the conditional variance and the realized measure. An empirical application with Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks and an exchange traded index fund shows that a simple Realized GARCH structure leads to substantial improvements in the empirical fit over standard GARCH models that only use daily returns.},

The objective of this paper is to examine seasonal and daily patterns in equity returns of four emerging markets: Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines. These markets are gaining importance with the globalization of business; therefore, it is necessary to examine the efficiency and functioning of these capital markets. Our analysis uses daily data for the 12 years from September 1, 1976, to June 30, 1988. The results support the existence of a seasonal pattern in these markets. Returns in the month of January are higher than any other month for all markets examined except the Philippines. A robust day‐of‐the‐week effect is also found. These markets exhibit a weekend effect of their own in the form of low Monday returns. In addition, there exists a strong “Tuesday effect,” which may be related to the + 13 hour time difference between New York and these emerging markets.

This study uses regression analysis with multiple dummies constructed by separating trading periods in every day into 12 return periods. This research finds that day of the week phenomena occur consistently in Indonesian Stock Exchange, but the occurrence are not evenly in the same day.

This paper considers three explanations for this phenomenon: (1) volatility is caused by public information which is more likely to arrive during normal business hours; (2) volatility is caused by private information which affects prices when informed investors trade; and (3) volatility is caused by pricing errors that occur during trading. Although a significant fraction of the daily variance is caused by mispricing, the behavior of returns around exchange holidays suggests that private information is the principle factor behind high trading-time variances.},
